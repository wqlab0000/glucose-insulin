From previous experiments we know that d =0.8 is most close to the scaled= 2 robustness results.
In this experiment we use d= 0.8 in G_2 >= 4.5 trace.
We do the Boolean connective of G_1 and G_2.


G_1 >= 4.5 /\ G_2 <= 9

Robustness is:
   -3.8697
   
Result figure is G15.fig 

The robustness is from lowest point to red real line.
