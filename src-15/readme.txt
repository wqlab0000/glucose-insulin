From previous experiments we know that d =0.8 is most close to the scaled= 2 robustness results.
In below experiment we use d= 0.8 in G_2 >= 4.5 trace, 
and we don't change the metric of G_1<=9 trace.
We do the Boolean connective of G_1 and G_2. 
Because the falsification of the hypoglycemia (low glucose) problem is 
much more serious than hyperglycemia (high glucose) problem.

G_1 >= 4.5 /\ G_2 <= 9

Robustness is:
   -3.8697
   
Result figure is G15.fig 

The robustness is from lowest point to red real line.
