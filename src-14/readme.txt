We designed a hypoglycemia experiments, with CHO = [70 100] lower than the planned CHO 150.
We generated 3 experiements.
d=0.8 robustness result is most close to the scaled (scale = 2) robustness.

1. G >= 4.5
2. G >= 4.5/d, d= 0.9
3. G >= 4.5/d, d= 0.8


Case 1:
Robustness scale = 2
Original Robustness: -0.96543;
Scaled Robustness:-1.9309

Case 2:
d=0.9
Scaled Robustness:  -1.4807

Case 3:
d=0.8
Scaled Robustness:  -2.0900
