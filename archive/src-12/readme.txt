We designed a hypoglycemia experiments, with CHO = [100 140] lower than the planned CHO 150.
We generated 3 experiements.
d=0.8 robustness result is most close to the scaled (scale = 2) robustness.

1. G >= 4.5
2. G >= 4.5/d, d= 0.9
3. G >= 4.5/d, d= 0.8

Case 1:
Glucose level trace G_1>=4.5
Robustness scale = 2
Robustness: -1.704495
 
 
 Case 2:
 d=0.9
Glucose level trace G_2>=4.5
Robustness: -1.383718


Case 3:
d=0.8;
Glucose level trace G_2>=4.5
Original Robustness: -1.383718
Robustness: -2.0163
