# glucose-insulin

Patients glucose over 9 for a long time can cause damage to eye, kidney, heart and blood vessels,
but glucose under 4.5 may lead to trembling or weak, under 2.5 can lead to coma or even death.
We see that glucose under 4.5 is much more dangerous than over 9.
Therefore ,we are trying to range the different scales of glucose falsification, 
and scale the glucose under 4.5.
